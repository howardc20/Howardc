<H3> Week 4 | 3D Scanning and Printing
</h3>
<p> 
The Assignment: 1.Combine two 3D print files using Meshmixer. You will need to scan your face and attach it to a pedastal base. The overall print should not be more than 4 inches tall. Print out the final file and make sure you document the process. 

2. Design and print small 3D object that could not be made subtractively.

3.With a partner or alone, create something useful using additive manufacturing. You will need to 3D print your useful object and the file must be your own creation. Some examples of useful objects can be found Useful 3D printed objects and here .

<H3>The Process</h3>
<p>
This task was one of the more challening ones, as it required you to really think about what you're making and understand the process. My favorite object, the one with my head on it, was really fun to make because I modeled in front of the class as Mr. Gerber photographed me. I wanted to make something that was funny, so I decided to make my head comedically small compared to the pedalstool that it rested on. I think it was a success because it looks like the pedalstool is a huge object and I am very small. For the second object, the machine must have made an error or something because, in the file, I had a small rabbit inside of the blue box, resting on top of the ball. However, when I attemped to print my object, the box filled in completely and drowned the rabbit.
