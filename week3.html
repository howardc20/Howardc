<H3> Week 3 | Computer Controlled Cutting</h3>
<p> 
The Assignment: 1. Design a clock using the laser cutter. The clock will be hung up on the wall in the Wang Innovation Center. You can use the materials in the WIC to create your clock. You will each be provided a 12" by 24" piece of 1/8 wood and a clock movement with hands. The design is entirely up to you and we will vote on the most creative clock once they are all hung on the wall. Be creative and use your vector and raster skills to create an impressive clock. The design must be original. When you have finished the clock, please give it to Mr. Gerber to hang on the wall. 2. Laser engrave a phone back.

<H3>The Process</h3>
<p>

  The clock was the most difficult endeavor we have taken on up to this point. It involved multiple steps and visualizing a design was tricky. In the end, I designed a Cleveland Cavs 2016 NBA Champions themed clocked because, no matter the time, the Cavs are World Champions. For the phone back, I used my favorite logo again, the WRA seal. For the clock, I cut using vector and rastor for the phone case.
