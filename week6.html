<H3>The Process
<p>
I have a long board that I occasionly ride at home, so I decided that I would make a longboard because I do not know how to ride a normal skatebaord. With Charlie, I glued the pieces together and wedged them between two wooden planks to stick together over night. I came back the followng day and my board had stuck together well and I was now ready to add some flair to the wood. I took tape and masked a zig-zag pattern onto my board. Then, I took Cherry Red spray paint and covered the front side of the board. I think the result is really cool. For the bottom side, I took my sticker with my name on it and attached it to the wood, which was a good use of the existing materials I had.
