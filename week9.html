The Process: First off, Mrs. Howell was a life-saver and she was super helpful with the entire process. I got the red plaid fabric that I wanted from the very start, even though I had second to last pick. I was pretty excited about this project and it was fun. I messed up my stitching multiple time and had to unstich everything and restart three times, but it wasn't too much of a hassle. I feel like that's kind of the story of my life in Digital Engineering: I am excited about the idea, but then I mess up some trivial task and have to restart everything again and again. However, like with stitching, I normally have a really strong understanding of what I am doing because I get lots of practice. I became the master of unstitching fabric. In the end, I really like how my pants turned out and can definetly see myself wearing them come next winter.
