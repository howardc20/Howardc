<p>  The Assignment: The production of your final project must utilize at least four different pieces of equipment and/ or significantly different process. It is highly recommended you discuss your project idea in advance with me to get permission for your final project. The preferred final project will involve four different pieces of equipment, but it is possible to submit multiple projects to meet this criteria. All final projects must be original in creation and not created by anyone else. It the work is not original, it will be considered a violation of our Honor Code. The project will be assessed based upon the quality, complexity, processes used, aestetics and functionality. You must create a separate page that documents how the project was created with multiple pictures documenting each step of the process. The page should model an Instructables page. YOU CANNOT HAVE A T-SHIRT AS YOUR FINAL PROJECT!

<H3>The Process</h3>
<p>
The four processes that I used: Corel Draw (CAD), Laser Engraving, 3-D printing, and Woodworking. For Corel Draw, I found a design online and downloaded it onto my computer, then I edited the Bitmap and made the image hairline. I saved it onto a USB flashdrive and inserted it into the laser engraving machine. I configured my settings to an 1/8 inch piece of wood and engraved it. After the laser process was finished, I took my over-sized piece of wood and cut it to my liking using a saw. Now, the big hiccup in my final project process came with the creation of the dog bowl. My goal was to put my dogs' dry dog food into the bowl, but when I returned to the 3-D printer after it was supposedly completed, only one layer of the dog bowl had printed. Just my luck. I huess the filament must have ran out, leaving me with a dog plate, not a bowl. I quickly improvised and decided to transform by 2-D bowl into a frisbee. I attached supports and, suprinsingly, it flies pretty well. While this is not at all what I imagined my final project would look like, I still learned a lot and was able polish some of my skills in the WIC.
