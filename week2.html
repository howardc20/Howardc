<H3> Week 2 | Garment, Sublimation and UV Printing</h3>
<p> 
The assignment for the week was to create an enclosure for an Arduino Uno or Raspberry Pi (raster, vector, 2D, 3D, render, animate, simulate, ...) and document it on my Class Page using Fusion360. I included pictures and original files on my page. I mentioned what worked and did not work when creating the enclosure.

<i> The Assignment: 1. Design an original T-Shirt and print it on the Brother GT-361 printer. It must be an original design and cannot use any copyrighted materials. The t-shirt must be about Hudson, WRA or Ohio. We are having a contest to see who can create a shirt that possibly will be featured in a business downtown. Make sure to include your original files, pictures of the process and finished product. 2. You also will need to complete your dye sublimination project on the Sawgrass 800 printer. In your portfolio, discuss how the process of dye sublimation works and what advantages does dye sublimation hold over UV printing. Include your original files and pictures of the final dye sublimination project. You can choose any of the products that we have or the keychain or pencil case. 3. You need to print using the UV printer. You can print on either a coaster, golf ball, puzzle or popsocket. Post all of your original files, pictures of the process and the finished product.

<H3>The Process</h3>
<p>
 The t-shirt that I designed was inspired by the "WRA Muscical", and I tried to design a shirt that could be marketed to WRA students. I think that the idea is smart, however, the execution was not very good because the ink kind of spread to the white part of the shirt. Unfortunatly, I deleted the original files and did not document the process. For the mug, I used a process called dye sublimation. We printed my WRA cross country logo onto a special piece pf paper and. then, wrapped the paper around the mug and held it in place and heated it. After some time, we took the paper off the mug and submerged it into water. This was a very cool process and it has a few advantages over UV printing, such as you do not an expensive printer to do this process, and, overall, it is a much cheaper process. For popsocket, I used the Roland Versa UV machine. I thought that the Reserve seal would fit well on the circular popsocket. Unfortunatly, I did not save any of the original files.
