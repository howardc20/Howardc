The Assignment: 1. Using the Roland GS-24 CAMM 1, cut a minimum of two one color vinyl stickers to decorate your notebook. The notebook must have at least two different one color stickers adorning the front, back or inside covers. 2. Design an 3D ORIGINAL .stl file to use in the MDX40A.
Mill the part using subtractive manufacturing using the MDX40A. You will mill in wax. It should be designed for a 3"x3"x .5" or 3"x2"x.5"
 Create a mold using Smooth-Sil 960.

<H3>The Process</h3>
<p>
During this assignment Ms. Fritz led the way, and she sent us a link to the WRA.fab sight and we followed the template to make the stickers. I chose to make a sticker of Santorini, Greece because I went their last summer and I really want to go back. I also made a sticker of this cool Cade logo I found online. I ended up putting the Cade sticker on my skateboard. For the Milling, I made my own piece on Fusion 360, which is pretty cool. I loved being able to eat white chocolate out of it.
